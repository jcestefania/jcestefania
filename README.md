## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects
- **[SpotifySongRecommender](https://github.com/jcestefania/SpotifySongRecommender)**: A C++ project for analyzing and recommending songs. It includes features like recommending songs and artists based on musical genres, and generating popularity rankings by artist or genre.
- **[Machine Learning Client Project](https://github.com/jcestefania/machine-learning-client-project)**: Data analysis for a client using machine learning. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics relevant to the client's business goals.
- **[Pathfinding Algorithm (A*)](https://github.com/jcestefania/Pathfinding-Algorithm-using-A-Star-in-a-2D-Matrix)**: This Python project implements the A* algorithm to find the optimal path in a randomly generated 2D matrix with obstacles. It allows users to choose between Manhattan and Euclidean distances for the pathfinding process. The matrix, along with the calculated path, is displayed on the console.
- **[ParallelSwarm](https://github.com/jcestefania/Parallel-SwarmOptimization-Project)**: A Python project that implements and compares several variants of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm using different parallelization strategies (threads, processes, asyncio, and a combined approach). Includes a full execution time analysis in Jupyter Notebook.
- **[Biblioteca API REST](https://github.com/jcestefania/biblioteca-api)**: REST API for managing a book library, with CRUD functionalities, Swagger documentation, and MongoDB connection using Mongoose. Developed with Node.js and Express.

## ðŸŽ“ Education
- **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science**: CUNEF University (2021â€“Present).  
  - Specialization in Computing.  
  - Honors in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
